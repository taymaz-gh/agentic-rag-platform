# Agentic RAG Platform

An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application combining semantic search, LLM-powered question answering, agentic workflows, product analytics, and application observability.

## Project Objectives

- Implement document ingestion, text embeddings, and semantic search.
- Build a RAG pipeline using LangChain and a vector database.
- Develop stateful, agentic workflows with LangGraph.
- Evaluate retrieval relevance and generated-answer quality.
- Track user behavior and experiments using PostHog.
- Monitor application performance using Datadog.
- Apply software engineering and MLOps practices, including testing, CI/CD, and containerization.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.12
- Git

### Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Note: The activation command above is for PowerShell. For Windows Command Prompt, use `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

Install the project and development dependencies:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the tests:

```powershell
python -m pytest -v
```

## Project Status

Under active development. The current milestone establishes the Python package structure and automated testing.

## Data

The project will use public or synthetic example documents. No confidential company data or API credentials will be committed to the repository.
